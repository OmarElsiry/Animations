## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (2.17 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rope-simulation-flutter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd rope-simulation-flutter
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## 🛠️ Customization

You can easily customize the simulation by modifying the following parameters:

- `segments`: Number of segments in each rope
- `gap`: Distance between rope segments
- `friction`: Rope movement friction
- `gravity`: Gravitational force applied to the ropes
- `tension`: Rope tension for physics calculations
